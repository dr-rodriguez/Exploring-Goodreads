# Script to carry out analysis of the data from the Goodreads API


# Questions To Answer:
# Are specific words used more often in reviews of a particular rating?
# Do I review more favorably what others review more favorably?
# Does the number of pages, or year of publication, have anything to do with how I review?
# What about the author?
# How fast do I read? Is this a function of the rating?

# Try out a regression tree or random forest analysis for fun
