I enjoyed the characters, especially Lightsong, and the mysterious magic of Breaths and BioChroma. The magic feels far more incomplete than, for example, Mistborn or Elantris, but it feels deliberate as I'm sure Sanderson will return to this world in the future. I reread this book because of two elements in it that appeared in Words of Radiance. It's interesting to see how Sanderson is starting to link the Cosmere books together.

Right from the get-go you realize how broken and shattered Auri is, even if you had no prior experience with her from Rothfuss's other books. It's amazing how she survives alone while devoting so much of her attention to how inanimate objects should be placed all over the underground world she lives in. Though, with names like Mantle, Tree, Foxen, and Fulcrum, and having seen the magic of The Name of the Wind, you suspect there may be something deeper there. Very little happens in this story- there is one character and almost no plot, but there is a soft, subtle magic in language, in repetition, in the melancholic musings of a young woman all alone.

You get to see another Hunger Games, which happens to be a Quarter Quell. The Quell's happen every 25 years and are extra special. If you thought the Capitol was bad in book 1, just wait until you read book 2.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that I can't connect too well with the primary character, Katniss. Firstly, she's a young teenage girl and I am male and older. While some of her actions do not conform to what I expect teenage girls think about (hunting, killing), other times she's just wallowing back and forth between her feelings for Peeta and Gale, which exasperated me and feels stereotypical. I guess she's just a complex character?<br/>The big problem I have with her, though, is that she is a bit dense. I picked up things and details very quickly in the book; sure I'm not in her shoes and perhaps in her situation such details would not be obvious. Still, I felt like screaming at her to figure it out: it was obvious! Needless to say, I saw the ending coming a mile away. Perhaps I just prefer more clever characters, ones that can surprise me with their wit and that can figure out things before the reader can.<br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Despite this, Sanderson manages to create a sense of mystery to the Aviar, the islands, and the Ones Above that drives the story. As always, Sanderson is a master of magic and he provides some partial, yet fulfilling, answers to how the magic of this world works. The book ends rather open-ended, letting the reader imagine what will happen in the future. Some of the secrets also spark my curiosity (ie, why Aviar and not humans?). I hope that Sanderson revisits the First of the Sun world as it sounds very cool (a distinct Polynesian vibe) and feels like the magic could be more fleshed out.<br/><br/>A full, but still short, review can be found in my blog: http://strakul.blogspot.com/2014/11/book-review-sixth-of-dusk-by-brandon.html",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The characters are top notch, even if their flaws make them a little too crude or violent for my tastes.

Despite being a group of adventurers, I felt they spent little time with each other and mostly they went off in their own business.

While some of his books are sprawling epics that takes weeks to read, this is a small well-contained book that reads in a flash. It almost feels too short! As I understand, there will be a few more books in the series to flesh it out, but the story is perfectly fine on its own. The characters are interesting and unique, you feel like you would have a great time hanging out with them. The setting, like all of Sanderson's books, is clever and imaginative.

I become the characters, carry out the plot, and explore the setting. Perhaps not everyone reads the same way I do, but it means that I allow stories to evoke feelings in me. When a story has banal, shallow, or repulsive characters, I have trouble enjoying the story. This is one such book. Maybe if I distanced myself a bit more, I would have better enjoyed it. The strong opinions of the characters were frequently unpleasant and the plot and setting are not outstanding, so I was left with a bitter opinion of the book.<br/><br/>In the end, the social commentary about culture, family, forgiveness, raising children, and the varying opinions on each was interesting, if delivered a bit heavy handedly. It is certainly a book that forces you to think and confront a lot of your biases and opinions. This is not a light read, so if you are giving it a go I would recommend detaching yourself from the story and, above all, try not to take any sides.

This is not that type of book: you get the first solution, and that's it. That's the answer. Just have to wrap up the story now. <br/>Fortunately, the humor and characters manage to make it enjoyable throughout.<br/><br/>A more detailed review is up on my blog: http://strakul.blogspot.com/2012/06/book-review-redshirts-by-john-scalzi.html",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I've you read the series up to book 6, you might as well finish it. This is a fast paced, epic conclusion to the series and in my opinion is one of the better books in the Saga.<br/><br/>The pros: fast action almost from the start, you get right to the meat of the conflict. The conclusion is suitably epic and satisfying. The series as a whole presents an interesting variety of social groups- Humans: the Hansa, the Roamers, the Therons, Ildirans, Klikiss (and their robots), and the Elementals: faeros, hydrogues, verdani and wentals. While the elementals are probably among the more interesting ones, the relationship between the human factions is more clearly fleshed out, considering most of the characters are humans.<br/><br/>The cons: the characters don't change too much in this book, in fact, throughout the entire series you have a very clear picture of who are the good guys and bad guys, you rarely see moral ambiguity or 3D characters. It seems, almost, that there are only 2-3 bad guys in the entire universe (with tons of lackeys to do their dirty work) and no one can stand up to them. All the other characters have perfect morality and in their naive simplicity will never once deviate from their beliefs even if doing so would solve so many problems. Only the 'bad' guys ever change sides. I would say the characters in the book (and the series as a whole) are probably the weakest part of the story.<br/><br/>Another minor issue is that the author makes an effort to describe where everyone is after the conflict. So after the climax, we still have 30-40 pages to read of so-and-so got married, so-and-so are now here, so-and-so are happy (no one is unhappy in the end). I think all of that cut have been cut and just go straight to the end, as the last chapter seemed to pack just a little bit more emotion than the prior ones.<br/>This slow ending is coincidentally similar to the slow start of the series.

I'm glad I did. I can't believe I've waited this long to read this.<br/><br/>While some books start with all the characters in one place and slowly build up to the full cast and the action, this is not one of those books. You start of right in the middle of the action and quickly start shifting view points. It can be a bit hard to follow what is going on or if events are relevant, but if you persevere you are rewarded. The various viewpoints and plots start tying up together and by the end everything is neatly in place. There are a few plots that get introduced and are not resolved, but it's clear that these will be address in the future books. <br/>The magic seems well structured and defined, though the reader is not privy to the details. Unlike some books, there is no 'apprentice mage' character that learns (along with the reader) how magic works and such. Hence, I am not to sure of the limits, but can attest to the power of some of the characters.<br/>The characters themselves are excellent.

It turns out the second one feels a bit more original and, to me, more enjoyable.<br/>There are two main plot lines and the story appears to lack focus, but once you get 3/4 of the way through everything snaps together and you realize that there was a purpose to all the meandering and even the smallest things become important. Also, the story becomes really interesting at that point and I could barely set it down.<br/>In terms of characters, we get to see more of Quentin and he sounds a bit more mature than in the prior book, eventually even becoming a likeable character (I didn't connect with him in book 1). Julia is now a prominent character and her story arc is very interesting. She never feels as real as Quentin, though, so I wasn't as invested in her story.<br/>The main plot is Quentin's quest, which starts of with him just wanting some adventure, but then actually evolves into a quest to save magic from its true owners- some cool stuff happens near the end. It left me wanting to read book 3 (there's a book 3 coming out, right?).<br/>Overall: it was a good book. I can't quite pin point why I didn't enjoy it more or why I enjoyed so much.

I can usually pass over scientific inaccuracies for the sake of the plot, but as a professional astronomer I am always happy when the author pays attention to detail and conforms his/her work to real science. That said, this is not hard scifi- there are no explanations on how drives work, etc, but the main point is that orbital mechanics (and thus the consequences of how space battles will be fought) is accurate.<br/>The story is also quite engaging. In scope it just covers the solar system and if you've ever taken an intro to astronomy course you should recognize all the places they visit. The characters are very interesting, but I wish there would have been more than 2 viewpoint characters.

I think there was only a single Jaime chapter and it left me wanting another one, which is unfortunate as we'll have to wait until next book.
