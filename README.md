# Exploring Goodreads Reviews

A quick look at my personal reviews on Goodreads.

Here are some questions I wanted to look into:

  * Which authors do I read?
  * How fast do I read? Has this changed over time or with rating?
  * Are specific words used more often in reviews of a particular rating?
  * How do my reviews compare to the average on Goodreads?
  * Can I predict how I will rate or review a book based on the information I can access?
 
You can find the details of my analysis (as of September 10, 2016) on my blog:
